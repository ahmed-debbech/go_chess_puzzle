2) hit mongo with uuid and add it to set

/seen?cid=44-44-444&pid=1234
1) directly hit mongo with uuid and store it as a set

/load
1) set pid to ramstore and calculate hash


hash equation:
exp : d5f7, h1h4, a8g2 [arr]
        5*7 + 1*4 + 8*2 = 55 [uniq]
        123455d5f7h1h4a8g2  [pid][uniq][arr]
        db2bea72fe15509fe830982d9b057f2b4a873b6714e45d5d6430707e24ebc7c3 [hash SHA256]


the ramstore:
key: pid, value: hash
